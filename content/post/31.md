title: now using xfce4
---
a good wm, quicker than kde while launching, and the font in this wm feels
good. although the simsun in xfce4 seems ....... but i can't deal the wheel,
so i can only use the scroll bar, a little un-convenience. OK, i have to check
the devel package of linux, perhaps it is the reason that i can't install ns.

btw:I like the little mouse of xfce4 ^_^
