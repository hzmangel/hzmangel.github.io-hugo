title: Ajax loading multi series to jqPlot
---
The [Ajax example of jqPlot](http://www.jqplot.com/tests/data-renderers.php)
only shows how to plot on series data, but the request I have met needs multi
series. The solution is easy, just record here for later reference.

In the example, The function used to load ajax data is `ajaxDataRenderer`,
which returns array of data. For multi series, just return more than one data
array. Here is a sample data set:

    
    
    [
      [
        [1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]
      ],
      [
        [5,1],[4,2],[3,3],[2,4],[1,5]
      ]
    ]
