title: LaTeX on my comp. is available again
---
After I re-install the OS, I improve the register to the system, but all the things was available except the ghostscript, and this failure made me cannot insert any .eps pic in my document. Yesterday, I download  the gs852w32.exe from the sourceforge, after I installed this software, my LaTeX was available again ^_^
