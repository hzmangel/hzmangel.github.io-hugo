title: be FTed again
---
i suppose that i have resolve the problem, and i can use ns2 tonight, but i am wrong, i don't know how to resolve it now. this afternoon, i can pass the mistake after edit the source, but i think i should install a newer gcc, so i download it. after run install in allinone, i have been bloked at the tclcl again, and this time the mistake made me very faint, the only description is

rm -f tcl2c++ g++ -o tcl2c++ tcl2c++.o ld: crtbegin.o: No such file: No such file or directory make: *** [tcl2c++] Error 1

i think i will be faint to death, sigh. i think tomorrow i have to re-install the gcc. OK,sleep now night.
