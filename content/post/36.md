title: Install ns successfully at last
---
after switch my Linux from MDK to Slackware, i can use it at last. Thanks Godness.
now i think i have no time to write smth about my Slackware, wait for days
the most important thing after install is to set enviroment variable, and the ns directory should place at a stable place, i think that is all, ns_allinone is easy for newbie.

btw:add enviroment variable:export PATH=ur path:$PATH, and if this command be added to ~/.xinited or ~/.bashrc, the enviroment variable will be added automaticly while booting.
