title: Install GRUB
---
p&gt;the acquiescent bootloader of Slackware is lilo, but i want to use GRUB,
so i have to install it.

i download the grub sourcr file to my disk, unzip, then install.  
use ./configure first, then make, make install. after that, i should use grub-
check to check my disk and install the stage1 and stage2 file to my /boot/grub
directory, and then use command under grub&gt;, the command is:  
  
grub&gt;root(hd0,4)  
grub&gt;setup(hd0)  
  
and i can use grub menu to loader my computer after edit /boot/grub/menu.lst,
or i have to input command instead of use array key and enter ^_^

btw:my grub still has some mistake, i can't loader Slackware, while it will
stop at kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount fs on hda5. and after i select
windows, i have to select a linux because of the lilo, which means i have
installed two bootloder ^_^ , i think i will do not resolve them after i can
loader the linux from grub or lilo, no time.
