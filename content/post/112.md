title: My first python script
---
Yesterday, I needed a shell script to do a demo of a program, and I thought
about python, so my first script was released today. But I have to say, it is
useless, because I haven't reach my goal :( .  The problem is not in the
script but in the program, so the only thing I can do is to abort, although I
do not want to say this word. I want to paste some code here because I want to
leave some useful command in my own space, so I can re-read them later ^_^

#!/usr/bin/python  
# import some useful modules  
import os  
import glob  
import sys  
import re  
import shutil  
import linecache

# def some functions  
# get the filename without pathname  
def get_filename(f_fullname):  
return os.path.split(f_fullname)[1]

# generate filename by replacing the str in filename  
def gen_filename(f_filename, f_src_ext, f_dst_ext):  
return re.sub(f_src_ext, f_dst_ext, f_filename)

# filter filename by extension and return a list  
fullname = glob.glob('res/bmp/*.bmp')

# get the filename(without extension) and return a new list  
bmp_file = map(get_filename, fullname)

# generate some filename  
ppm_file = [gen_filename(file, 'bmp', 'ppm') for file in bmp_file]  
pgm_file = [gen_filename(file, 'bmp', 'pgm') for file in bmp_file]  
icp_file = [gen_filename(file, 'bmp', 'icp') for file in bmp_file] ..........

The module shutil allows u using copy and move, and the linecache module
supports reading a whold line from a file, they both are useful

Just seen some doc of python, it seems that this is a powerful tools, I hope
that I can study it deeper ^_^
