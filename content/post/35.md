title: My debian
---
My debian hasn't installed successfully, because it can't recognize my NIC, and i check the message, the IRQ of my cards is 0, so while i using ifconfig or ifdown ifup, it tells me that the resource is temporarily unavailable. and i can't find the key now, wait for the next term.
