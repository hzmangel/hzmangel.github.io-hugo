title: Using Slackware now
---
because of the ns, and i cannot set the IRQ of NIC in debian, so switch to Slackware

a little Linux, only 2CDs, and costs about 2.5G on my computer. after copy the font in windows, i can use simsun in slackware, although not so beautiful. and the most important thing is that i can install ns on the system, thanks godness.

but i can't use middle button to copy, and sth else, i will find them later. ^_^
