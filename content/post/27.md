title: re-install Successfuly
---
i have re-install the MDK just now, from the HDD. While i use the old menu of the GRUB for install, the system.told me that there are "kernel panic", and after i check the command and compare the command of lilo, i add a command
initrd (hd0,4)/isolinux/alt0/all.rdz
and the problem has been resolved.
but i can't input chinese now :(

btw: i have found a error of my previous article, about the command of install from HDD *^_^*
