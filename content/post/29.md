Just send a mail to the mailist, the first use mailist.
The only thing i can do now is to wait the reply, i can't find the reason, why this can be installed successfully on othes' computer?

Windows has blue-screen again, i do not know why, too. Perhaps because of the drivers. but i haven't met those problems before, reinstall perhaps will take no effect, because i have checked the drivers, but i can't find the different drivers, faint a lot. i think next term i have to check the whole computer.
