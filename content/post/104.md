title: glut+MinGW+Windowz
---
Those days I have had a lot of faint things, coding with OpenGL is one of them.
I do not want to use VC++ 6 as my develop environment, so I choosen the MinGW, and the IDE I use is Dev-Cpp, which is a good IDE. But in most time, I just use the MinGW environment command line to compile and execute the code, because I like it ^_^
At the beginning, I copy the code from NeHe tutorial to my Dev-Cpp project, at first the project I used is normal win32 project, so I have got a lot of errors. Later I began to know that I should use the opengl project, after I do this, all errors had gone and the code run well.
Some days before, I began to study the tutorial of offical guide, the code in it was not use "windows.h" but the "gl/glut.h", and when I complieing the code, errors back again :(
Yesterday I have found a solution of the error, first I install the optimized opengl package for MMX, and I install the glut package for dev-cpp, then I can use the demo finally.
