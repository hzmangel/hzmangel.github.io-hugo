---
Just found a method: get a codec package named all-20040916.tar.bz2, and then
use command:  
tar -jxvf all-20040916.tar.bz2  
then copy all the file in the package to /usr/lib/win32, creat the folder if
it is not exist, then config the xine, locate the codec folder, it is said
that all type of the movie can be played ^_^  
and now, i am watching conan :-)  
although the ns has no reply :(
