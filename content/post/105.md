title: QccPack is available
---
Just download the QccPack from http://qccpack.sf.net, and apt-get the imake. Extrate, imake, make Makefiles, make, make install.... after a long time, I install it successfully. But when I use some commands of this pack, I got an error, it tells me that "cannot open shared object file", after google it, I know the reason, and I copy the .so and .a file to /lib, the problem is resolved.
