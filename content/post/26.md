title: Linux again
---
Haven't here for a long time, because of the exam, although i hate them very much :(
and haven't under Linux for a long time, too, Because for the grub.

Today, i repair the GRUB, I do it successfully, the first time, so i want to write sth here ^_^

1st, i think i should find a bootable disk, a CD, because i have no floopy, and my motherboard do not support boot from USB port :(
2nd, i find grub_for_dos, it is a useful tool, which is a grub prog with a DOS shell.
3rd, use bootable disk boot my computer, then enter the pure DOS(grub must be installed under the real mode, not the vm86 mod).
4th, change dir to the grub_for_dos, under the promote 'grub&gt;', input two command:
&gt;root (hd0,4)
&gt;setup (hd0)
the first command is to define the root director of the grub(of course we can install this from the grub_for_dos, but i have a installed grub, and my session is to install it to MBR.), the second command is to setup the grub to the MBR, if (hd0) replaced by (hd0,4), the GRUB will install to the partition. and, that's all ^_^
