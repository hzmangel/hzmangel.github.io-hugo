title: Show alert box in calendar operations of iOS6
---
With the new permission schema in iOS6, app should acquire authentication
before accessing calendar. So the code for calendar operation should be
surrounded like this:

    
    
    EKEventStore *eventStore = [[EKEventStore alloc] init];
    EKEvent *event  = [EKEvent eventWithEventStore:eventStore];
    
    [eventStore requestAccessToEntityType:EKEntityTypeEvent completion:^(BOOL granted, NSError *error) {
        if (granted) {
            // Calendar operation
        }
    }];
    

As you can see, the code for calendar operation is written in a block.

After the operation completed, you may want to show customer an alert box to
say the operation is done. But, showing a UIAlertView object in block will not
perform expected action. The reason is because of the event loop. I am still
studying it, so will update it later.

The correct way to show an alert box is using `dispatch_async` function to put
the operation block to main queue, which looks like this:

    
    
    [eventStore requestAccessToEntityType:EKEntityTypeEvent completion:^(BOOL granted, NSError *error) {
        if (granted) {
            // Calendar operation
            dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
                UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc]
                                      initWithTitle:@"Event Added"
                                      message:nil
                                      delegate:nil
                                      cancelButtonTitle:@"OK"
                                      otherButtonTitles:nil];
                [alert show];
            }
    
        }
    }];
